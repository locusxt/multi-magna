Since multiMAGNA++ uses pthreads, we need a POSIX compliant compiler with pthreads support to compile it.
In Unix and Mac OS X, you can use gcc and its variants. For Windows, either Cygwin or MingGW will work.
To compile in Unix, Mac, Cygwin, or MinGW, run make clean and then
make all

For Windows, since Visual C++ doesn't support pthreads (and a bunch of other POSIX stuff that I used), I opted to use MinGW.
Here is what I did specifically.
1. I went to http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/ and followed the instructions to install MinGW-w64 (either 32-bit or 64-bit)
2.
To compile with MinGW, run make clean and then
make all
